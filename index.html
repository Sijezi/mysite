  <h3>About Me</h3>
<p class="lead"> 
	Hello and welcome! 
	<br>
	My name is Leyth, I'm a CS student with interests in web technologies and distributed systems. Not to mention that I am also a passionate JavaScript Developer with strong critical thinking and communication skills. 
	<br>
	My love for web development and teaching has led to my current position at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, where I am afforded the opportunity to assist an eclectic student base in mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
	<br>
	In order to pursue new frontiers in web development, I have enrolled in the Application Development Bachelor's Degree at North Seattle College. My broader educational experience additionally includes the study of JavaScript and GIS at the University of Washington as well a BA in Geography.

	My hopes and dreams are to use tech for positive impact.
