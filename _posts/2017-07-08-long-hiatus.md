title: After a long hiatus!
---

I have not had the chance to write anything for a long while, but hopefully that will change soon. As you shall see, I will continue and update the algorithm section. This might include an actual implementation in JavaScript.

Recently, I've been reading `Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript` by Michael McMillan, and I must say that this is a pretty good introduction to algorithms in JavaScript. The book covers the following topics:

- Arrays and lists: the most common data structures
- Stacks and queues: more complex list-like data structures
- Linked lists: how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays
- Dictionaries: storing data as key-value pairs
- Hashing: good for quick insertion and retrieval
- Sets: useful for storing unique elements that appear only once
- Binary Trees: storing data in a hierarchical manner
- Graphs and graph algorithms: ideal for modeling networks
- Algorithms: including those that help you sort or search data
- Advanced algorithms: dynamic programming and greedy algorithms


In other words, I will post and cover each topic in the order which they're shown above, starting with the most common data structures, arrays and lists.

Basically, my plans are to implement these basic algorithms in multiple langauges———starting with JavaScript, the lin·gua fran·ca of the web.

Until then . . .
