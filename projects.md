User Interface (UI) | <span style="color:  #D85950">HTML & CSS</span>
----------------------------------------
I, along with teammates, built a UI for a bookstore website. We were given a mockup of the UI along with their assests. For the first phase of this project, we were only allowed to use `HTML` and `CSS`, meaning, we were not expected to build the functional tabs interfaces. Hence, no JavaScript was added.

Neighborhood Map | <span style="color:  #D85950">JavaScript, HTML & CSS</span>
----------------------------------------
I developed a single-page application in KnockoutJS framework. The project features a map of my neighborhood's parks and recreational centers utilizing google maps API. I added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list-view to support simple browsing of all locations. I also included the FourSquare API to pull important location data.

UdaciFeeds: Feed Reader Testing | <span style="color:  #D85950">Jasmine</span>
----------------------------------------

Used the red-green-refactor workflow to develop the UdaciFeeds project. I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application included Jasmine, but with incomplete test suites. I completed all the required tests by:

- <span style="color: #D85950">Validating opinions</span>
- <span style="color: #D85950">Identifying and defining expectations</span>
- <span style="color: #D85950">Writing expectations in code</span>
